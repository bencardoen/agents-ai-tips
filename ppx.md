# Perplexity Tips

Pointers for using Perplexity Pro effectively.

## Query Strategy
- Phrase prompts as explicit questions; follow up with “show your sources” when detail matters.
- Use `focus` mode or domain filters to keep the retrieval narrowed to relevant verticals.
- Share snippets or tables when asking for comparisons so Perplexity can align responses precisely.

## Citation Handling
- Expand each citation to confirm it matches the quoted claim before sharing the result.
- Save citation links to a scratch file if you will need them when writing docs or PRs.
- Flag dead links or mismatched citations; re-run the query with refined filters.

## Collaboration
- Stitch Perplexity answers with local context by pasting key repo paths or config snippets.
- Summarize the combined insights back to the agent you are pairing with (e.g., Codex) to keep context aligned.
- Document noteworthy findings in the repo so teammates can build on the research.
