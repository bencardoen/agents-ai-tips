# Privacy Policy – Paper Review Agent Prompt Loader

This integration exposes a single read-only endpoint serving a static markdown configuration file for the Paper Review Agent.

- No personal data is collected, logged, or stored by this endpoint beyond standard HTTP server logs managed by GitHub or the hosting provider.
- The endpoint does not process, inspect, or persist any content sent by users via ChatGPT; it only returns the same static file to all callers.
- Any personal or research data you share with ChatGPT is handled solely under OpenAI’s terms and privacy policy, not by this endpoint.

For questions about this endpoint, please open an issue in this repository.
