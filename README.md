# Agent-ai-tips 

This repo holds as the name says 'things I wish I'd known before I started using CGPT, Perplexity, Claude etc'.

**NOTE**
For now at least, this is written from my perspective, I use Fedora 41 and mostly code-insiders with Perplexity Pro/CGPT Plus.
Most of my coding is in Julia with some Matlab/Python, so the configuration files reflect that.

Happy to accept PRs.
